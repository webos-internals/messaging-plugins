Assuming you've installed Pidgin from source (typically in /usr/local):

	./configure --prefix=/usr/local
	su -c "make install"

and eveything should be fine. If Pidgin is installed from an RPM (I don't know if the pidgin headers were separated from binaries) or DEB (you pidgin-dev package), then:

	./configure --prefix=/usr
	su -c "make install"

Installing those should get Pidgin Sipe working.
