In order to compile for win32 you will need mingw32, and a build of libpurple
as well as glib for win32 ready.

The easiest is to cross-compile from Fedora, and use libpurple-mini.

Always make sure the cross-compilation environment is correct:

 % export PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/lib/pkgconfig
 % export CROSS_COMPILE=i686-pc-mingw32-

= libpurple =

Libpurple is the only dependency not available in Fedora:

 % git clone git@github.com:felipec/libpurple-mini.git
 % cd libpurple-mini
 % make prefix=/opt/win32 SSL=n install

= msn-pecan =

Fedora includes a mingw32-gettext package that uses libintl-8.dll,
unfortunately most GTK+ packages use intl.dll. So you'll need to copy
libintl.dll.a into the win32 subdir.

You can get it from here:
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies/gettext-runtime-dev-0.17-1.zip

Then you can build msn-pecan:

 % export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/win32/lib/pkgconfig
 % make

That's it! Copy libmsn-pecan.dll to your plugins directory on Pidgin :)

 * Create builds to ease the process (glib and libpurple)
